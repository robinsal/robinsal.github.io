# HTML Google Homepage Decoy

From The Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

## Description
This is an HTML project that creates a copy of the simplified visuals of the Google homepage.

## Purpose
This is my first HTML project. I am hoping to gain some experience with using HTML and CSS to achieve a specific goal that is not too far out of reach, and also practice using the Firefox developer tools.
