# Etch-A-Sketch

From The Odin Project's curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

## Description

This is a javascript project that builds the HTML DOM using JavaScript code. It creates an program similar to an Etch-A-Sketch
wherein the user flips the color of a cell very time they hover over it, allowing them to "draw" a pixelated picture.

## Purpose

This is my first JavaScript project. This was intended to give me practice using JavaScript instead of HTML
to build and alter the DOM tree and also creating interactive components to webpages.
