      <h1>Game of Life</h1>
      <p>This is a simple JavaScript program that alters
	<br>the DOM Tree and creates allows you to play<br>
        the Game of Life. Enjoy!</p>
      <br>
      <p>
	Rules of the game:<br>
	Cells are either 'alive' or 'dead'.<br>
	Live cells are black, dead cells white.<br>
	A live cell will stay alive if it has 2 or 3<br>
	live neighbors, and will die otherwise.<br>
	A dead cell will come to life if it has exactly
	3 live neighbors.<br>
      </p><br>
      <p>
	This game was created by John Conway, and it<br>
	produces some pretty cool visuals. I recommend<br>
	you begin by clicking Set Random Board to start out,<br>
	and then you can set any cell to be alive by clicking on<br>
	it. Update the game by clicking Update. To create interesting<br>
	visuals, click the Update button rapidly.<br>
